# hello-world
My first repository 

Hello I'm SubbornShiba
I'm interested in breakdancing, gaming, kickbacks at buddies house's, surfing the internet, anime, and many other hobbies
I'm currently learning how to regain back majority of my life because of a special event that happened in my life, I was studying c++ in college, and made simple programs like a calculator, or little projects that was required through class. We used visualbasic majority of the time, so I'm still brand new to the whole git, dreamweaver, python, and many more avenues!
I'm looking to collaborate on anything that'll help me grow or learn at my own pace. I have a keen sense of being open to learn anything, however the challenge within itself is whether I could make it make sense to me. Patience is key, and communciation is a plus for me.
